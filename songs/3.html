There is no height or depth
Neither life nor death
That can take me from all that I find
Here now in Your glory Lord

No other powers or love
The things of now or to come
There's nothing on Earth, in this life
That could ever separate us Lord

Your love is never ending
To your hands we surrender
Where all our sins are washed away
Your grace beyond reason
Has paid for our freedom
We're made alive in You

We run to Your throne
Where we belong
Every heart will sing
That Jesus is Lord
Casting all else aside
For the joy of our Christ
Let Your glory fall
Our hearts are filled with Your fire
