You were God from the outset
Powerful and creative
You who saw us here before You called
All the stars and the earth to existence

You are God You are holy
History is Your story
You who was and is
And who forever will be
God we live for Your glory

So we will run
All together our hearts aflame
With a fire that can't be tamed
Our God all glory to Your Name Jesus

You are God You are freedom
You're alive now within us
You who saw us here before
You conquered the grave
And delivered on the promise

We will run
Our surrender to bring You fame
Our desire that You be praised
Our God all glory to Your NameJesus
